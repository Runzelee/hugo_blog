I'm too busy doing school learning tasks to buy the domain back since the domain expired after blogging with WordPress in 2020.  
Today I migrated my blog to Hugo and rebuilt it, hoping I will write new articles more frequently in the future.
    
Of course, my needs for my personal website are not only blogs. I will add more functions for frontend learning, such as small games, weather components and other interactions.  

Set up a small plan:  
> At least one article per month, unlimited field.
 
Wish I can do it.  
You can also supervise me to prevent my laziness.ğŸ‘‹
