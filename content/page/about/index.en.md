## Hi there

I'm a student that ready to graduate from junior middle school from China, like coding something for fun.  
I'm also a programming and science hobbyist.  
You can call me Runze.  

Languages I can basically use:
 - Java
 - Kotlin
 - Python  

Still learning:
 - Go
 - C#
 - HTML/CSS
 - Javascript

I have recently focused on Android development and intermittently started a new project, but it was temporarily put on hold due to the tight school learning tasks.

Regards.
